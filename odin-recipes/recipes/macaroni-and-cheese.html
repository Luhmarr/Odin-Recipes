      <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is the classic baked Mac and Cheese of my childhood. You can add sun-dried tomatoes if you wish, or sometimes I substitute minced garlic for the salt and pepper to give it added <em>zing!</em> It can make Saturday Night more fun!</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Macaroni noodles</li>
          <li>Sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
          <li>Butter</li>
          <li>Salt and Pepper for taste</li>
          <li>Evaporated Milk</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bring slighty salted water in a big pot to a boil. Add the pasta cooking for 8-10 minutes,then drain.</li>
          <li>Grease a 2 quart casserole dish. Place a quarter of the macaroni in the bottom, followed by an even layer of one-quarter of the cheese slices. Dot with butter and season with salt and pepper. Repeat layering three times. Pour evaporated milk evenly over the top of all.</li>
          <li>Bake, uncovered, for one hour, or until top is golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
